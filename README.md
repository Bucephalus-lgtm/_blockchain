### Blockchain and Cryptocurrency | Full-Stack MERN

A web app developed primarily on nodejs through which you can generate a transaction and mine the transactions. 


For running the app in your PC locally, you should have installed REDIS SERVER in your PC. As I've used it for the peer to peer(P2P) connection in the eniter network of blockchain. You can install redis from <a href="https://redis.io/download.">here</a>


Then, ypu simply run npm run dev in your terminal.

In case you get some error to run the app because of redis running in background, please head to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14816892/how-to-keep-redis-server-running" > this. </a>
